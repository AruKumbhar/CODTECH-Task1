Overview of the project:
Project: Simple Calculator Using Python Programming

Objective
The objective of a simple calculator using Python is to create a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Learning experience: It provides hands-on experience with the Python language.
Understanding coding logic: It helps you understand the basics of coding logic.
Understanding arithmetic operations: It helps you understand arithmetic operations.
Understanding user-input functions: It helps you understand user-input functions.

Key Activities:
Prompting the user
Ask the user for input, such as two numbers and an operator 
Defining functions
Create functions for each arithmetic operation, such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() 
Using conditional statements
Apply conditional statements to allow the user to choose how the calculator functions 
Creating a loop
Use a while loop to continue asking the user if they want to perform another calculation 

Technologies Used
Variables: Used to save user input, such as the first and second numbers, and the operation 
Built-in functions: Used to perform arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
Conditional statements: Used to perform operations based on the user's input 
If-elif statements: Used to develop a basic or advanced calculator 
User input: Prompted using the input() function 
While loops: Used to continue asking the user if they want to perform another calculation 
is_integer function: Used to print the output without the decimal if the result is an integer
